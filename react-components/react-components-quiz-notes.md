## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a React component?
  Functions that typically take in data in the form of a props object, and use that data to create reusable UI elements that contain HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
- How do you define a component in React?
  Class components are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component and must implement a render() method, which returns the JSX to be rendered. Function components, on the other hand, are simpler and can be written as functions that return JSX directly.
- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?
  By either exporting or importing the component and calling them.
